# ACT Implementor

The ACT Implementor is a tool that can be used to create and maintain an ACT implementation report. These reports can then be used to determine the consistency and coverage of implementations like accessibility test tools and evaluation methodologies.

This tool is specifically designed for manual and semi-automated accessibility testing solutions. For fully automated accessibility test tools it is recommended to build a test runner that outputs JSON+EARL instead. See [ACT Test Runner](https://github.com/act-rules/testrunner) for details.

## Development

This tool is built using Vue 3.2+ and TypeScript.
